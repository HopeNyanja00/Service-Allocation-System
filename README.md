# Toyota Malawi Vehicle Service-Allocation-System

The Toyota Malawi Vehicle Allocation System is a project that developed a web-based system that
automates the allocation of vehicles for servicing and maintenance purposes in Toyota Malawi. The system
was designed to address the challenges associated with the manual allocation process, including the
inefficiencies in vehicle assignment, delays, and errors. 

The project involved conducting a thorough review of the existing system, identifying its limitations, and
developing a set of requirements that would guide the design and implementation of the new system. The
system was designed using an agile development approach, which involved iterative cycles of development,
testing, and feedback. 

The final system includes features such as a user-friendly interface, scheduling of service appointments,
user chat bot and notification updates. The system also includes a dashboard for managers to view analytics
and allocate service dates.
